# Bayesian Data Analysis Matlab/Octave Demos
This repository contains some Matlab/Octave demos for the book [Bayesian Data
Analysis, 3rd ed by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin (BDA3)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).

Currently there are demos for BDA3 Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11. Furthermore there is a demo for [MatlabStan](https://github.com/brian-lau/MatlabStan).

These demos were written for Matlab/Octave by Aki Vehtari.

These demos are not maintained any more. I recommend to use the
corresponding [R demos](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_R_demos) and
[Python demos](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_py_demos) which are
maintained.
